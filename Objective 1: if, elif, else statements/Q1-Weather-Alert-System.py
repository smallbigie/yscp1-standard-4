# This program will check the temperature and give a weather update

temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in 째C: "))

# Complete the if-elif-else logic here

if temperature > 30:
    print("Hot")
elif temperature <10:
    print("Cold")
elif temperature == 25:
    print("Perfect Weather")
else:
    print("moderate")
